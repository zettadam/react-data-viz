            Data visualization is a collection of methods that use visual representations
            to explore, make sense of, and communicate quantitative data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>immediate</strong> purpose of data visualization is to <u>improve understanding</u>.
            When data visualization is done in ways that do not improve understanding, it is done poorly.
            The <strong>ultimate</strong> purpose of data visualization, beyond understanding,
            is to <u>enable better decisions and actions</u>.

            Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets
            designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace
            people with computational decision-making methods. The design space of possible vis idioms is huge,
            and includes the considerations of both how to create and how to interact with visual representations. <u>Vis
            design is full of trade-offs</u>, and <strong>most possibilities in the design space are ineffective</strong> for
            a particular task, so validating the effectiveness of a design is both necessary and difficult.
            Vis designers must take into account <u>three very different kinds of resource limitations:
            those of computers, of humans, and of displays</u>.
            Vis usage can be analyzed in terms of <strong>why</strong> the user needs it, <strong>what</strong> data
            is shown, and <strong>how</strong> the idiom is designed.

      <p>A primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and efficiently via graphs, plots and charts to increase understanding.</p>
